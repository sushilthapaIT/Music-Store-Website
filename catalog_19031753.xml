					<h1>Description</h1>
					<p>
					On this melancholy song Eminem raps about his struggles with drug addiction. In August 2005
					Eminem entered drug rehabilitation in order to treat a dependency on sleep medication. He subsequently
					took a break during which he battled his addiction whilst industry insiders speculated that Shady had
					ended his rapping career. Eminem is now sober and he told Vibe magazine that this song is the only one
					he kept from the recordings he made during that dark period in his life. He explained: "One of the only
					reasons that I put that track on there is that I feel like it's the best song out of that batch that I 
					did when I wasn't sober. At the time I felt like, 'This is it for me.' I wrote the first verse and a 
					half in rehab, and when I came out, I finished it. It was the only song that marks that period without 
					bringing me back to that place. Every other track not only didn't fit with the album, but when I listened
					to it, it would bring up bad memories. This was the 5th song of that title to chart in the Hot 100."

					<h1>Description</h1>
					<p>
					"Save Your Tears" is a song by Canadian singer the Weeknd for his fourth studio album After Hours (2020).
					"Save Your Tears" received universal acclaim. Billboard hailed the song as the best track on After Hours,
					stating: “Although "Save Your Tears" is one of the most pop-driven songs on the album, The Weeknd doesn't 
					hold back when it comes to the rather cold nature he usually finds himself adopting when it comes to his lovers.
					The production remains upbeat and steady the entire time, thanks to work from Max Martin, Oscar Holter, DaHeala,
					and The Weeknd himself, combining the best of his old content and some newer, more mainstream-driven sounds”.
